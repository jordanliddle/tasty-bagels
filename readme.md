# TastyBagel : Powered by Rails 4 and Bootstrap

TastyBagel is a sandwich ordering service built using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) frameworks. This was a pet project I took on to better understand various aspects of Rails 4 in action, including, but not limited to:

* **RESTful APIs** 
* **Validation and Unit testing** 
* **MVC Framework** 
* **Deployment and Production** 
* **Active Record Migrations, Associations, Callbacks ** 
* **Authentication and Authorization** 
* **Action Mailer** 
* **Caching and Performance** 
* **Ajax & Rails** 
* **Asset Pipeline** 


In addition to gaining a deeper understanding of Rails, I also exercised some front-end development using Bootstrap, SASS, jQuery and other technologies.
